# Calc
For analyzing simulations. Observables are primarily contact- or energy-based.

## To Do:
* Observable class for calc. Observable can be energy or contact based. Hold
methods for parameterizing observable function that takes in MDTraj
trajectory object.
* Covariance between arbitrary observables.
